While CardUdatr can operate as a stand-alone web application in most implementations you will want to embed or launch the CardUpdatr application within your existing experience. There are two options when hosting CardUpdatr within your existing application or website:

1.	__Launching and Embedding__ --- Learn the different mehanisms for implementing CardUpdatr into your application or web site.  Strivve provides a bootstrap library for enabling the experience that works for you.

2.	__Single Sign On__ --- While this option does require deeper technical integration it provides a much better user 
experience because the user is authenticated by your website before CardUpdatr use within your application. When the user 
is authenticated, your site or application passes the cardholder card details and cardholder address information directly to CardUpdatr removing the manual entry by the cardholder.
